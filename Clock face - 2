QUES: 
Hour hand turned by x degrees since the midnight. 
Determine the angle by which minute hand turned since the start of the current hour. 
Input and output in this problems are floating-point numbers. 

HINT: 
angle covered by hour hand in 1 hour = 30 degree
angle covered(since the start of the hour) by hour hand = x % 30
1 degree(hour hand) = 12 degree(minute hand)
angle covered(since the start of the hour) by MINUTE hand = ( x % 30 ) * 12


CODE:
a=float(input())
a=a%30
print(a*12)
